# Signing requests with JWT

All requests must be signed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with the corresponding serviceâ€™s service token.

Signing options should include the `iat` property to provide a time-limit and mitigate against replay attacks.

## POSTs
The token must be passed as a header called `x-access-token`

## GETs
The token must be passed as a query parameter `payload`
